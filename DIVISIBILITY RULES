simple rules for determining if a number is divisible by 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 14, and 15. Instead of lengthy calculations
Here are examples for the divisibility rules discussed

*   **Divisibility by 2:**
    *   **5648** is divisible by 2 because its last digit is 8.
    *   **2750** is divisible by 2 because its last digit is 0.
    *   **3746** is divisible by 2 because its last digit is 6.
    *   **5647839** is *not* divisible by 2 because its last digit is 9.

*   **Divisibility by 3:**
    *   **564** is divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (5+6+4 = 15) is divisible by 3.
    *   **47789** is *not* divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (4+7+7+8+9 = 35) is *not* divisible by 3. (Note: The transcript states 4+7+8+9 = 28 in, which is the sum of digits, but still 28 is not divisible by 3).

*   **Divisibility by 4:**
    *   **98496** is divisible by 4 because its last two digits, 96, are divisible by 4 (96 ÷ 4 = 24).
    *   **97486** is *not* divisible by 4 because its last two digits, 86, are *not* divisible by 4.

*   **Divisibility by 5:**
    *   Examples of numbers divisible by 5 include **100, 105, 2090, 3095, 495, 65** because their last digit is either 0 or 5.
    *   **96479805** is divisible by 5 because its last digit is 5.
    *   A number like **9647980** (if the last digit 5 is removed) is *not* divisible by 5 because its last digit is 0 (it should be 0 *or* 5). (Correction: the example was **9647980** before the 5 was added, implying the last digit was 0 and it was divisible by 5. The speaker then removed the 5 and said the number is *not* divisible because the last digit isn't 0 or 5. This implies the number became `964798` with a last digit of 8, which is indeed not divisible by 5).

*   **Divisibility by 6:**
    *   **5648** is *not* divisible by 6 because, although it is divisible by 2 (last digit is 8), the sum of its digits (5+6+4+8 = 23) is *not* divisible by 3. For a number to be divisible by 6, it must be divisible by *both* 2 and 3.
    *   **9834** is divisible by 6 because it is divisible by 2 (last digit is 4) and the sum of its digits (9+8+3+4 = 24) is divisible by 3.

*   **Divisibility by 8:**
    *   **4678512** is divisible by 8 because its last three digits, 512, are divisible by 8 (512 ÷ 8 = 64).
    *   **4968564** is *not* divisible by 8 because its last three digits, 564, are *not* divisible by 8.

*   **Divisibility by 9:**
    *   **576** is divisible by 9 because the sum of its digits (5+7+6 = 18) is divisible by 9.
    *   **6759** is divisible by 9 because the sum of its digits (6+7+5+9 = 27) is divisible by 9.
    *   **7658** is *not* divisible by 9 because the sum of its digits (7+6+5+8 = 26) is *not* divisible by 9.

*   **Divisibility by 10:**
    *   Examples of numbers divisible by 10 include **100, 1000, 98980, 89560** because their last digit is 0.
    *   **1009** (likely meant 1000 with a 9 at the end as an example, though the transcript says "1000 ఉందండి ఇప్పుడు ఇది డివిజబుల్ అవుతుందా కాదు ఎందుకు లాస్ట్ డిజిట్ జీరో లేదు 9 ఉంది") is *not* divisible by 10 because its last digit is 9.

*   **Divisibility by 11:**
    *   **564789** is *not* divisible by 11 because the difference between the sum of digits at odd places (5+4+8 = 17) and the sum of digits at even places (6+7+9 = 22) is 5 (|17-22|=5), which is *not* divisible by 11.
    *   **979374** is divisible by 11 because the sum of digits at odd places (9+9+7 = 25) and the sum of digits at even places (7+3+4 = 14) have a difference of 11 (|25-14|=11), which is divisible by 11.

*   **Divisibility by 12, 14, and 15:**
    *   The sources explain the *rules* for these numbers but do not provide specific numerical examples for each.
        *   A number is divisible by **12** if it is divisible by both 3 and 4.
        *   A number is divisible by **14** if it is divisible by both 2 and 7.
        *   A number is divisible by **15** if it is divisible by both 3 and 5.

*   **General Practice Example:**
    *   The number **574689** is given as an example to check for divisibility by multiple numbers.
        *   It is *not* divisible by 2 because its last digit is 9.
        *   It *is* divisible by 3 because the sum of its digits (5+7+4+6+8+9 = 39) is divisible by 3.
        *   It is *not* divisible by 4 because its last two digits, 89, are *not* divisible by 4.
        *   It is *not* divisible by 5 because its last digit is neither 0 nor 5.
        *   It is *not* divisible by 6 because it is *not* divisible by 2.
        *   It is *not* divisible by 7 (checked by direct division).
        *   It is *not* divisible by 8 because its last three digits, 689, are *not* divisible by 8.
        *   It is *not* divisible by 9 because the sum of its digits, 39, is *not* divisible by 9.
        *   It is *not* divisible by 10 because its last digit is not 0.
        *   It is *not* divisible by 11 because the difference between the sum of odd-placed digits (5+4+8 = 17) and even-placed digits (7+6+9 = 22) is 5, which is *not* divisible by 11.
        *   It is *not* divisible by 12 because it is *not* divisible by 4.
        *   It is *not* divisible by 14 because it is *not* divisible by 2 and 7.
        *   It is *not* divisible by 15 because it is *not* divisible by 5, even though it is divisible by 3.
        *   Therefore, this specific number (574689) is only divisible by 3 among the discussed numbers.
Divisibility Rule for 7:
To check if a number is divisible by 7, follow these steps:

Take the last digit of the number.

Double it.

Subtract this doubled value from the rest of the number (the number without the last digit).

If the result is divisible by 7 (including 0), then the original number is divisible by 7.

You can repeat this process until you get a small enough number to easily check.

Example:
Is 203 divisible by 7?

Last digit: 3

Double it: 3 × 2 = 6

Remaining number: 20

Subtract: 20 − 6 = 14

Since 14 is divisible by 7, 203 is divisible by 7.
