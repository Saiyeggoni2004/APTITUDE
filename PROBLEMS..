Here are the problems and their solutions as presented:
These examples demonstrate the consistent method: **understand the sentence, convert it to a mathematical expression/equation using defined interpretations of keywords (like 'of' for multiplication, 'half' for 1/2, 'exceeds'/'more than' for difference, 'times' for multiplication, 'is' for equality), simplify using basic arithmetic and algebraic manipulation, and finally, ensure the specific question asked is answered**.

*   **Problem 1: What is 2/3 of half of 669?**
    *   **Interpretation and Conversion:**
        *   "2/3" is written as `2/3`.
        *   "of" is interpreted as **multiplication (`*`)**.
        *   "half" is interpreted as **`1/2`**.
        *   The phrase is converted into the mathematical expression: `2/3 * 1/2 * 669`.
    *   **Simplification and Solution:**
        *   The `2` in `2/3` and `1/2` cancel each other out.
        *   The remaining expression is `1/3 * 669`.
        *   `669` is divided by `3`: `3 * 2 = 6`, `3 * 2 = 6`, `3 * 3 = 9`.
        *   **Result:** The final answer is **223**.

*   **Problem 2: If 1/3 of 1/4 of a number is 30, then 3/10 of the number is...**
    *   **Interpretation and Conversion (Part 1 - Finding the number):**
        *   "1/3 of" becomes `1/3 *`.
        *   "1/4 of" becomes `1/4 *`.
        *   "a number" is an unknown, so it's represented as `x`.
        *   "is 30" means `= 30`.
        *   The equation for the first part is: `1/3 * 1/4 * x = 30`.
    *   **Simplification and Solution (Part 1 - Finding x):**
        *   Multiply the fractions: `(1*1)/(3*4) * x = 30` which is `1/12 * x = 30`.
        *   To find `x`, multiply `30` by `12`: `x = 30 * 12`.
        *   `x = 360`.
    *   **Interpretation and Conversion (Part 2 - Finding 3/10 of the number):**
        *   "3/10 of the number" becomes `3/10 * x`.
        *   Substitute the found value of `x`: `3/10 * 360`.
    *   **Simplification and Solution (Part 2):**
        *   Cancel the zero in `10` and `360`: `3 * 36`.
        *   **Result:** The final answer is **108**. The speaker emphasises the importance of finding the number first, then answering the specific question asked.

*   **Problem 3: 1/2 of 3/4 of a number is 2 1/2 of 30.**
    *   **Interpretation and Conversion:**
        *   "1/2 of 3/4 of a number" is `1/2 * 3/4 * x`.
        *   "is" implies equality (`=`).
        *   "2 1/2 of 30": first, convert the mixed fraction `2 1/2` to an improper fraction: `(2*2+1)/2 = 5/2`. Then, "of 30" means `* 30`. So, `5/2 * 30`.
        *   The full equation is: `1/2 * 3/4 * x = 5/2 * 30`.
    *   **Simplification and Solution:**
        *   Left side: `3x/8`.
        *   Right side: `2` cancels with `30` to give `15`, so `5 * 15 = 75`.
        *   Equation becomes: `3x/8 = 75`.
        *   Multiply both sides by `8`: `3x = 75 * 8`.
        *   `3x = 600`.
        *   Divide by `3`: `x = 600 / 3`.
        *   **Result:** The number is **200**. The speaker notes that the problem asked for the number itself.

*   **Problem 4: If the sum of two numbers, one of which is 2/5 times the other, is 100, then the numbers are...**
    *   **Interpretation and Conversion:**
        *   "Sum of two numbers is 100" means `number1 + number2 = 100`.
        *   "one of which is 2/5 times the other": If one number is `x`, the other is `2/5 * x`.
        *   The equation is: `x + 2/5x = 100`.
    *   **Simplification and Solution:**
        *   Find the LCM (Lowest Common Multiple) for the fractions: `5x + 2x / 5 = 100`.
        *   `7x / 5 = 100`.
        *   `7x = 100 * 5`.
        *   `7x = 500`.
        *   One number (`x`) is `500/7`.
        *   The second number (`2/5x`) is `2/5 * (500/7)`.
        *   `2/5 * 500/7 = (2*100)/7 = 200/7`.
        *   **Result:** The two numbers are **500/7 and 200/7**.

*   **Problem 5: If 3/4 of a number is 14 more than 1/6 of the number.**
    *   **Interpretation and Conversion:**
        *   "3/4 of a number" is `3/4x`.
        *   "1/6 of the number" is `1/6x`.
        *   "is 14 more than" implies a **difference of 14**, with the first part being larger. So, `3/4x - 1/6x = 14`.
    *   **Simplification and Solution:**
        *   Find the LCM of `4` and `6`, which is `12`.
        *   Convert fractions: `(3*3)x/12 - (2*1)x/12 = 14`.
        *   `9x/12 - 2x/12 = 14`.
        *   `7x/12 = 14`.
        *   `7x = 14 * 12`.
        *   `7x = 168`.
        *   `x = 168 / 7`.
        *   The number (`x`) is `24`.
    *   **Answering the Specific Question:** The problem asks for **5/3 of the number**.
        *   `5/3 * 24`.
        *   `3` cancels with `24` to give `8`.
        *   `5 * 8 = 40`.
        *   **Result:** The final answer is **40**. The speaker strongly advises always reading the entire question to ensure the correct final answer is given, not just the intermediate number.

*   **Problem 6: If 1/2 is added to a number and sum is multiplied by three, the result is 24.**
    *   **Interpretation and Conversion:**
        *   "a number" is `x`.
        *   "1/2 is added to a number" is `x + 1/2`.
        *   "and sum is multiplied by three" means the *entire sum* is multiplied, so `(x + 1/2) * 3`.
        *   "the result is 24" means `= 24`.
        *   The equation is: `(x + 1/2) * 3 = 24`.
    *   **Simplification and Solution:**
        *   Divide both sides by `3`: `x + 1/2 = 24 / 3`.
        *   `x + 1/2 = 8`.
        *   `x = 8 - 1/2`.
        *   Find LCM: `x = (16 - 1) / 2`.
        *   `x = 15/2`.
        *   **Result:** The number is **15/2**. The speaker notes that in this case, only the number itself was asked for.

*   **Problem 7: If 4/5 of a number exceeds its 3/4 by 16.**
    *   **Interpretation and Conversion:**
        *   "4/5 of a number" is `4/5x`.
        *   "its 3/4" means `3/4x`.
        *   "exceeds ... by 16" means the difference is 16, and `4/5x` is larger. This is similar to "more than" or "difference".
        *   The equation is: `4/5x - 3/4x = 16`.
    *   **Simplification and Solution:**
        *   Find LCM of `5` and `4`, which is `20`.
        *   Convert fractions: `(4*4)x/20 - (5*3)x/20 = 16`.
        *   `16x/20 - 15x/20 = 16`.
        *   `x/20 = 16`.
        *   `x = 16 * 20`.
        *   `x = 320`.
        *   **Result:** The number is **320**. Again, the speaker reminds to check if a fraction or multiple of the number is asked for in the final step.

*   **Problem 8: If sum of three numbers is four, the first number is 1/2 times the second number and third number is 1/4 times the second number.**
    *   **Interpretation and Conversion:**
        *   "Sum of three numbers is four" means `num1 + num2 + num3 = 4`.
        *   "Second number is common", so let **second number be `x`**.
        *   "First number is 1/2 times the second number" means `num1 = 1/2 * x`.
        *   "Third number is 1/4 times the second number" means `num3 = 1/4 * x`.
        *   The equation is: `1/2x + x + 1/4x = 4`.
    *   **Simplification and Solution:**
        *   Find LCM of `2` and `4`, which is `4`.
        *   Convert fractions: `(2*1)x/4 + (4*1)x/4 + (1*1)x/4 = 4`.
        *   `2x/4 + 4x/4 + x/4 = 4`.
        *   `(2x + 4x + x) / 4 = 4`.
        *   `7x / 4 = 4`.
        *   `7x = 4 * 4`.
        *   `7x = 16`.
        *   `x = 16/7`.
        *   **Result:** The problem asked for the **second number**, which is `x`. So, the answer is **16/7**. The speaker also shows how to find the first number (`16/7 * 1/2 = 8/7`) and the third number (`16/7 * 1/4 = 4/7`) if they were asked.
