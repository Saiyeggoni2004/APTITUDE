### ‚úÖ Methods of Finding **LCM**

#### **1. Traditional Method**

List the multiples of each number and pick the least one common to all.

* **Example: LCM of 4, 5, and 6**

  * Multiples:

    * 4 ‚Üí 4, 8, 12, ‚Ä¶ **60**
    * 5 ‚Üí 5, 10, 15, ‚Ä¶ **60**
    * 6 ‚Üí 6, 12, 18, ‚Ä¶ **60**
  * **LCM = 60**

---

#### **2. Factorization Method**

Use prime factorization and take the highest powers.

* **Example: LCM of 8, 12, and 64**

  * 8 = 2¬≥, 12 = 2¬≤ √ó 3, 64 = 2‚Å∂
  * **LCM = 2‚Å∂ √ó 3 = 192**

* **Example: LCM of 12, 8, and 15**

  * 12 = 2¬≤ √ó 3, 8 = 2¬≥, 15 = 3 √ó 5
  * **LCM = 2¬≥ √ó 3 √ó 5 = 120**

---

#### **3. Division Method**

Use successive division with common primes.

* **Example: LCM of 8, 12, 6, and 4**

  ```
  2 | 8  12  6  4
  2 | 4  6   3  2
  2 | 2  3   3  1
  3 | 1  3   3  1
      1  1   1  1
  ```

  * **LCM = 2 √ó 2 √ó 2 √ó 3 = 24**

* **Example: LCM of 12, 8, and 15**

  * **LCM = 2 √ó 2 √ó 2 √ó 3 √ó 5 = 120**

* **Example: LCM of 24, 36, and 40**

  * **LCM = 2 √ó 2 √ó 2 √ó 3 √ó 3 √ó 5 = 360**

---

#### **4. Shortcut Method**

Check multiples of the highest number in the set.

* **Example: LCM of 3, 15, and 45**

  * Highest = 45
  * 45 is divisible by 3 and 15
  * **LCM = 45**

* **Example: LCM of 3, 11, and 15**

  * Prime: 11; LCM of 3 & 15 = 15
  * **LCM = 15 √ó 11 = 165**

---

### ‚úÖ Methods of Finding **HCF**

#### **1. Traditional Method**

List all factors and take the highest one in common.

* **Example: HCF of 2, 4, and 8**

  * Factors of 2 = 1, 2
  * Factors of 4 = 1, 2, 4
  * Factors of 8 = 1, 2, 4, 8
  * **HCF = 2**

---

#### **2. Factorization Method**

Prime factorize and pick the lowest powers of common primes.

* **Example: HCF of 27, 18, and 36**

  * 27 = 3¬≥, 18 = 2 √ó 3¬≤, 36 = 2¬≤ √ó 3¬≤
  * Common prime = 3¬≤
  * **HCF = 9**

* **Example: HCF of 12, 6, 8, and 4**

  * Common prime = 2 (lowest power is 1)
  * **HCF = 2**

---

#### **3. Division Method**

Apply the Euclidean algorithm.

* **Example: HCF of 70 and 90**

  * 90 √∑ 70 = remainder 20
  * 70 √∑ 20 = remainder 10
  * 20 √∑ 10 = remainder 0
  * **HCF = 10**

* **Example: HCF of 132 and 360**

  * Continue until remainder is 0
  * **HCF = 12**

---

#### **4. Shortcut Method**

Check if the smallest number divides the others.

* **Example: HCF of 27, 18, and 36**

  * Try 18 ‚Üí doesn‚Äôt divide 27
  * Try next: **9**, which divides all
  * **HCF = 9**

Example: HCF of 24, 42, and 30

Try 24 ‚Üí not valid

Next: 12 ‚Üí not valid

Try 6 ‚Üí divides all

HCF = 6
