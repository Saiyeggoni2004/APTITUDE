Here's a breakdown of the methods and concepts discussed:
### LCM and HCF of Fractions

When given numbers in fraction form, specific formulas are used to calculate their LCM and HCF:

*   **LCM of Fractions** = (LCM of Numerators) / (HCF of Denominators)
*   **HCF of Fractions** = (HCF of Numerators) / (LCM of Denominators)

The video emphasizes that the concept is straightforward: if you need to find the LCM of fractions, you find the LCM of the numerators and the HCF of the denominators, and vice-versa for HCF of fractions.

**Examples:**

1.  **Find the LCM of 2/15, 3/5, and 6/25**:
    *   **LCM of Numerators (2, 3, 6):** The highest number is 6. Since 6 is a multiple of 2 and 3, the LCM is 6.
    *   **HCF of Denominators (15, 5, 25):** The lowest number is 5. Since 5 is a factor of 15 and 25, the HCF is 5.
    *   **Final Answer (LCM of Fractions):** 6/5.

2.  **Find the LCM of 27/50, 9/20, and 6/25**:
    *   **LCM of Numerators (27, 9, 6):** The highest number is 27. 27 is a multiple of 9, but not of 6. Therefore, check multiples of 27. The next multiple is 54 (27 * 2). 54 is a multiple of 9 (9 * 6) and 6 (6 * 9). So, the LCM is 54.
        *   *(Procedural/Division Method Check):* For 27, 9, 6:
            *   Divide by 3: 9, 3, 2
            *   Divide by 3: 3, 1, 2
            *   No common factors remaining. Multiply all factors: 3 * 3 * 2 * 3 = 54.
    *   **HCF of Denominators (50, 20, 25):** The lowest number is 20. 20 is not a factor of 50 or 25. Find factors of 20: 10, 5, etc.
        *   Consider 10: 10 is a factor of 50 but not of 25.
        *   Consider 5: 5 is a factor of 50, 20, and 25. So, the HCF is 5.
        *   *(Procedural/Difference Method Check):*
            *   Difference between 50 and 20 is 30.
            *   Difference between 20 and 25 is 5.
            *   To find HCF of 30 and 5, divide 30 by 5. 5 * 6 = 30. The remainder is 0, and the divisor is 5. So, HCF is 5.
    *   **Final Answer (LCM of Fractions):** 54/5.

3.  **Find the LCM of 2/3, 4/9, 5/6, and 7/12**:
    *   **LCM of Numerators (2, 4, 5, 7):** The numbers 5 and 7 are prime numbers with no common factors. The LCM of 2 and 4 is 4. Multiply 4 by 5 and 7: 4 * 5 * 7 = 140.
    *   **HCF of Denominators (3, 9, 6, 12):** The lowest number is 3. Since 3 is a factor of 9, 6, and 12, the HCF is 3.
    *   **Final Answer (LCM of Fractions):** 140/3.

4.  **Find the HCF of 4/9, 10/21, and 20/63**:
    *   **HCF of Numerators (4, 10, 20):** The lowest number is 4. 4 is not a factor of 10. Find factors of 4: 2. 2 is a factor of 4, 10, and 20. So, the HCF is 2.
    *   **LCM of Denominators (9, 21, 63):** The highest number is 63. Since 63 is a multiple of 9 and 21, the LCM is 63.
    *   **Final Answer (HCF of Fractions):** 2/63.

The video suggests practicing many problems to improve calculation speed and understand the short-cut methods.

### LCM and HCF of Decimals

To find the LCM or HCF of decimals, they must first be converted into whole numbers.

**Procedure:**
1.  Identify the decimal with the highest number of digits after the decimal point.
2.  Multiply all the given decimals by a power of 10 (10, 100, 1000, etc.) that will convert all of them into whole numbers. For example, if the highest number of digits after the decimal is two, multiply by 100; if it's three, multiply by 1000.
3.  Calculate the LCM or HCF of these newly converted whole numbers using standard methods.
4.  Finally, divide the result (LCM or HCF) by the same power of 10 that was used for multiplication in step 2. This step balances the initial multiplication.

**Examples:**

1.  **Find the LCM of 1.2, 1.5, and 2.5**:
    *   **Convert to Whole Numbers:** All numbers have one digit after the decimal, so multiply by 10. This gives 12, 15, 25.
    *   **LCM of (12, 15, 25):**
        *   Using the division method:
            *   Divide by 3: 4, 5, 25
            *   Divide by 5: 4, 1, 5
            *   No more common factors. Multiply: 3 * 5 * 4 * 1 * 5 = 300.
        *   Using the short-cut method (highest number 25, find its multiples until it's a multiple of 12 and 15) also results in 300.
    *   **Final Answer:** Divide the LCM by 10: 300 / 10 = 30.

2.  **Find the LCM of 1.20, 0.24, and 6**:
    *   **Convert to Whole Numbers:** The numbers 1.20 and 0.24 have two digits after the decimal point. So, multiply all by 100. This gives 120, 24, and 600 (6 * 100).
    *   **LCM of (120, 24, 600):**
        *   Using the short-cut method: The highest number is 600. 600 is a multiple of 120 (120 * 5) and 24 (24 * 25). So, the LCM is 600.
        *   *(Procedural/Division Method Check):* For 12, 24, 600 (after dividing by 10 as first step in video):
            *   Divide by 12: 1, 2, 50
            *   Divide by 2: 1, 1, 25
            *   Multiply: 12 * 2 * 1 * 1 * 25 = 600.
    *   **Final Answer:** Divide the LCM by 100: 600 / 100 = 6.

3.  **Find the LCM of 0.12, 0.96, and 0.6**:
    *   **Convert to Whole Numbers:** Highest digits after the decimal are two. Multiply all by 100. This gives 12, 96, and 60 (0.6 * 100).
    *   **LCM of (12, 96, 60):**
        *   Using the division method:
            *   Divide by 3: 4, 32, 20
            *   Divide by 4: 1, 8, 5
            *   No more common factors. Multiply: 3 * 4 * 1 * 8 * 5 = 480.
    *   **Final Answer:** Divide the LCM by 100: 480 / 100 = 4.8.

4.  **Find the HCF of 0.06 and 1.2**:
    *   **Convert to Whole Numbers:** Highest digits after the decimal are two (in 0.06). Multiply all by 100. This gives 6 and 1200 (1.2 * 100).
    *   **HCF of (6, 1200):** Using the division method: Divide 1200 by 6. Since 6 * 200 = 1200, the remainder is 0, and the divisor is 6. So, the HCF is 6.
        *   Alternatively, 0.06 directly divides 1.2, so 0.06 is the HCF.
    *   **Final Answer:** Divide the HCF by 100: 6 / 100 = 0.06.

### Relationship Between Two Numbers, Their LCM, and HCF

The video introduces a fundamental formula relating two numbers (n1 and n2) to their LCM and HCF:

**Product of Two Numbers = Their LCM × Their HCF**
**n1 × n2 = LCM × HCF**

**Proof/Example:**
Let's take two numbers, 12 and 8.
*   **Product of Numbers:** 12 * 8 = 96.
*   **LCM of (12, 8):**
    *   Divide by 4: 3, 2
    *   No common factors. Multiply: 4 * 3 * 2 = 24. So, LCM = 24.
*   **HCF of (12, 8):** Using the division method:
    *   Divide 12 by 8: 8 * 1 = 8, remainder is 4.
    *   Now divide 8 by 4: 4 * 2 = 8, remainder is 0.
    *   The divisor at remainder 0 is 4. So, HCF = 4.
*   **Product of LCM and HCF:** 24 * 4 = 96.

Since the product of the numbers (96) is equal to the product of their LCM and HCF (96), the formula is proven.

This formula is useful for finding a missing value when the other three are known.

**Example Problem:**
**The LCM and HCF of two numbers are 1260 and 63, respectively. If one of the numbers is 315, find the other number**.
*   Given: LCM = 1260, HCF = 63, n1 = 315.
*   Formula: n1 × n2 = LCM × HCF.
*   Substitute values: 315 × n2 = 1260 × 63.
*   Solve for n2: n2 = (1260 × 63) / 315.
*   Calculation:
    *   Simplify 63/315. Both are divisible by 63 (63 * 1 = 63, 63 * 5 = 315).
    *   So, n2 = 1260 / 5.
    *   n2 = 252.
